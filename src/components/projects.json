        "content": "Ada health is a digital health companion that takes your symptoms and suggests possible causes, as well as whether or not you should seek medical attention. This project was in conjunction with Sutter Health, a large health insurance provider in California, in order to better advise their patients on their patient portal, and to direct them to the appropriate medical facility, but has since been expanded to other health systems, as well as clinical trials through the global health department of Ada. Built with react, express, and vanilla-javascript.",

This was done by developing a multi-tenant platform solution by which other hotel-booking websites owned by the HRS group could also generate their websites, which had similar functionality, but could now be made more consistent, maintainable, and extendable.",
